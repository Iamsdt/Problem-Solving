    /*
    * Dhananjay has recently learned about ASCII values.He is very fond of
    * experimenting. With his knowledge of ASCII values and character he has
    * developed a special word and named it Dhananjay's Magical word.
    * A word which consist of alphabets whose ASCII values is a prime number
    * is an Dhananjay's Magical word. An alphabet is Dhananjay's Magical alphabet
     * if its ASCII value is prime.
     *
     * Dhananjay's nature is to boast about the things he know or have learnt
     * about. So just to defame his friends he gives few string to his friends
     * and ask them to convert it to Dhananjay's Magical word. None of his friends
      * would like to get insulted. Help them to convert the given strings to
       * Dhananjay's Magical Word.
       *
       * Rules for converting:
       *
       * 1.Each character should be replaced by the nearest Dhananjay's Magical alphabet.
       * 2.If the character is equidistant with 2 Magical alphabets.
        * The one with lower ASCII value will be considered as its replacement.
        *
        * Input format:
        *
        * First line of input contains an integer T number of test cases.
         * Each test case contains an integer N (denoting the length of the string) and a string S.
        * Output Format:
        *
        * For each test case, print Dhananjay's Magical Word in a new line.
        *
        * SAMPLE INPUT
        * 1
        * 6
        * AFREEN
        *
        * SAMPLE OUTPUT
        *
        * CGSCCO
