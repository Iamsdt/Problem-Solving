# what a fucking question
#
#  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
#  in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
#  of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.
# if you square a sequence (ascending order), it will be sorted in ascending order.


# sqr(n) is always less that sqr(n+1)
